  - The project introduction must clearly describe the purpose and main features of the project
  - The Getting Started section must include prerequisites and detailed installation steps
  - Code examples must use Markdown code block format with specified language
  - Use emojis moderately, with a maximum of one per major section
  - Documentation requires appropriate heading hierarchy, with main sections using level two headings (##) and subsections using level three headings (###)
